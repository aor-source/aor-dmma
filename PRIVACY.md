# Privacy Policy for Contributors

**Effective Date:** February 6, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026

## Purpose

AoR-DMMA is a sensitive research project studying algorithmic bias against African American Vernacular English. The integrity of this codebase directly impacts research findings that document systemic erasure of Black linguistic identity by AI systems.

Because of the nature and sensitivity of this work, we maintain strict contributor identity and access controls. This policy explains what data is collected from contributors and why.

## What We Collect

When you interact with this repository (fork, clone, push, open PRs, comment, or review), the following information is recorded:

1. **IP Address** — GitHub logs your IP address on every git operation and API interaction. This project relies on those logs for security auditing.
2. **Git Identity** — Your `user.name` and `user.email` as configured in git.
3. **GitHub Account Metadata** — Your GitHub username, display name, account creation date, and public profile information.
4. **Contribution History** — All commits, PRs, reviews, and comments are permanently recorded in git history and GitHub's audit trail.
5. **Timestamps** — Date and time of all interactions.

## VPN and Proxy Services Are Not Permitted

**Contributors must not use VPN, proxy, Tor, or any IP-masking service when interacting with this repository.**

This is a security requirement, not a suggestion. If you are unwilling to contribute from a traceable IP address, you may not contribute via GitHub. See "Alternative Contribution Method" below for an option that respects your privacy while still meeting our security needs.

### Why?

This project has experienced unauthorized modifications, phantom collaborator additions, and unexplained commit attributions. We need to be able to trace every interaction back to a real person at a real location if a security incident occurs. Masked IP addresses make forensic investigation impossible.

## How We Use This Data

Contributor data is used **exclusively** for:

- **Security incident investigation** — Tracing unauthorized access, phantom commits, or tampering
- **Identity verification** — Confirming contributors are who they claim to be
- **Audit compliance** — Maintaining a complete chain of custody for all code changes

We will **never**:

- Sell or share contributor data with third parties
- Use IP addresses for marketing, profiling, or surveillance
- Publish contributor IP addresses publicly

## Data Retention

- **Git history** (names, emails, commits) — Retained indefinitely as part of the permanent research record
- **GitHub audit logs** — Retained per GitHub's data retention policy
- **IP addresses** — Retained by GitHub per their privacy policy; we do not maintain a separate IP log beyond what GitHub provides

## Your Rights

- You may request to know what data GitHub has logged about your interactions (via GitHub's privacy tools)
- You may choose not to contribute if you do not accept these terms
- You may use the alternative email contribution method described below

## Alternative Contribution Method

If you are not comfortable with IP logging or the identity requirements for direct GitHub contributions, you may submit contributions by email:

1. Prepare your changes as a patch or include the full modified code in the email body.
2. Include your **full legal name** and a brief explanation of the changes.
3. Send to: **k8xhyw6xb9@privaterelay.appleid.com**
4. Subject line: `[AoR-DMMA Contribution] Brief description of changes`

The repository owner will review your submission and, if accepted, commit the changes with proper attribution to your stated name. This method allows you to contribute without exposing your IP address to GitHub, while still maintaining identity accountability.

**Note:** Email contributions are reviewed at the owner's discretion and may take longer to process than pull requests.

## Consent

By forking, cloning, pushing to, or opening pull requests against this repository, you acknowledge and consent to:

1. Your IP address being logged by GitHub on all interactions
2. Your git identity (name, email) being permanently recorded
3. The prohibition on VPN/proxy/Tor usage when interacting with this repository
4. Your contributions being subject to the identity verification requirements in CONTRIBUTING.md

**If you do not consent to these terms, do not interact with this repository.** Use the email alternative instead.
